    falwa is a package that contains modules to compute the finite-amplitude
    local wave activity (FALWA) and reference state (U_ref) in the following papers:
    Huang and Nakamura (2016, JAS): http://dx.doi.org/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1
    Huang and Nakamura (2017, GRL): http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GL073760/full
    Nakamura and Huang (2018, Science): https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat0721
    Neal et al (2022, GRL): https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL097699

    The current version of the library handles calculation of FALWA in a spherical barotropic model and QGPV fields on 
    isobaric surfaces.

    The functions in this library can compute the tracer equivalent-latitude relationship
    proposed in Nakamura (1996) (Also, see Allen and Nakamura (2003)) and the (zonal mean)
    finite-amplitude wave activity in spherical geometry as in Nakamura and Solomon (2010).
