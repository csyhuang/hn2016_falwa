falwa: Finite-amplitude local wave activity
==================================================

.. image:: https://github.com/csyhuang/csyhuang.github.io/raw/master/assets/img/falwa_diagram.png

`falwa <https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa>`_ is a python library that provides tools to measure and study life cycle of large-scale
extreme weather events. It implements the finite-amplitude local wave activity and flux diagnostic introduced in:

- `Huang and Nakamura (2016, JAS) <https://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/abs/10.1175/JAS-D-15-0194.1>`_
- `Huang and Nakamura (2017, GRL) <https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/2017GL073760>`_
- `Nakamura and Huang (2018, Science) <https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aat0721>`_

Package Installation
------------------------------

**Attention: substantial changes took place in release v2.0.0. Installation in develop mode is no longer available.**

Since release v2.0.0, the F2PY modules in `falwa` is compiled with `meson` (See Issue #95 for details) to cope with the deprecation of `numpy.disutils` in python 3.12.

First-time installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. To build the package from source, you need a fortran compiler (e.g., [gfortran](http://hpc.sourceforge.net/)) to implement the installation.
2. Clone the package repo by `git clone https://github.com/csyhuang/hn2016_falwa.git` .
3. Navigate into the repository and set up a python environment satisfying the installation requirement by `conda env create -f environment.yml`. The environment name in the file is set to be `falwa_env` (which users can change).
4. Install the package with the command `python -m pip install .`. The compile modules will be saved to python site-packages directory.
5. If the installation is successful, you should be able to run through all unit tests in the folder `tests/` by executing `pytest tests/`.

Get updated code from new releases
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

1. To incorporate updates, first, pull the new version of the code from GitHub by `git pull`.
2. Uninstall existing version of `falwa`: `pip uninstall falwa`
3. If there is change in `environment.yml`, remove the existing environment by `conda remove --name falwa_env --all` and create the environment again from the updated YML file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`.
4. Reinstall the updated version by `python -m pip install .`.
5. Run through all unit tests in the folder `tests/` by executing `pytest tests/` to make sure the package has been properly installed.

Quick start
-----------------------------------------

There are some readily run python scripts (in `scripts/`) and jupyter notebooks (in `notebooks/`) which you can start with.
The netCDF files needed can be found in `Clare's Dropbox folder <https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fo/b84pwlr7zzsndq8mpthd8/h?dl=0&rlkey=f8c1gm2xaxvx3c7cf06vop6or>`_.

Depending on what you want to do, the methods to be use may be different.

1. If you solely want to compute equivalent latitude and local wave activity from a 2D field, you can refer to `notebooks/simple/Example_barotropic.ipynb`. This is useful for users who want to use LWA to quantify field anomalies.

2. If you want to compute zonal wind reference states and wave activity fluxes in QG Formalism, look at `notebooks/nh2018_science/demo_script_for_nh2018.ipynb` for the usage of `QGField`. This notebook demonstrates how to compute wave activity and reference states presented in Nakamura and Huang (2018). To make sure the package is properly installed in your environment, run through the notebook after installation to see if there is error.
