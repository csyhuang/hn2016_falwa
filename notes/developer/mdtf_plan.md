The goal to incorporate Finite-amplitude wave activity (FAWA) formalism into MDTF repo is to provide diagnostic tools for model comparison. Each diagnostic shall associate with an interpretation related to the physical process.

Below are some proposed candidates and associated physical interpretations:

| Variable                                                                              | Interpretation                                                                                                                                             |

| Seasonal climatology of zonal mean FAWA                                               | It quantifies the strength of vertically propagating planetary waves, and also relative strength of synoptic eddies in troposphere|
| Seasonal climatology of Uref                                                          | To quantify strength of mean-flow interaction, i.e., adiabatic adjustment of flow from an eddy-free reference state is given by Uref-Ubar(zonal mean wind) |
| Seasonal climatology of vertically integrated LWA                                     | To quantify geographical distribution (and amplitude) of eddies|
| Seasonal climatology of temporal Covariance of \<LWA\> and \<U\> (as in NH18 Fig. 2A) |A measure of strength of nonlinear wave-mean flow interaction (via nonlinear zonal wave activity flux)|
