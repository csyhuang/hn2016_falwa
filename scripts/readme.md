# Scripts directory

This directory contains ready-to-run python scripts for various purposes explained below.

## Publication-related

- `nhn_grl2022/`: contains instructions and python scripts (see `sample_run_script.py`) to reproduce the figures in [Neal et al 2022](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2021GL097699). 

## Demos

- `pre_process_data_in_hybrid_coordinates/`: contains scripts that demonstrate how to *preprocess* the climate model output in hybrid coordinates to be consumed by `falwa.oopinterface.QGField` to compute finite-amplitude wave activity and fluxes. Thanks [Pragallva Barpanda](https://github.com/Pragallva) for the contribution.
